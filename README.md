# CS378 : Human-AI interaction 

Course description:

Artificial intelligence (AI) is already transforming society and every industry today.
In order to ensure that AI serves the collective needs of humanity, we as computer scientists must
guide AI so that it has a positive impact on the human experience. This course is an introduction to 
harnessing the power of AI so that it benefits people and communities. We will cover a number of general
topics such as: agency and initiative, AI and ethics, bias and transparency, confidence and errors, 
human augmentation and amplification, trust and explainability, and mixed-initiative systems. 
We explore these topics via readings and projects across the AI spectrum, including: dialog and speech-controlled systems, 
computer vision, data science, recommender systems, text summarization, and UI personalization, among others.
