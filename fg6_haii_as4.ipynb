        "# Language models\n",
        "A language model is an algorithm that takes a sequence of words, and outputs the likely next word in the sequence. Most language models output a list of words, each with its probability of occurance. For example, if we had a sentence that started `I would like to eat a hot`, then ideally the algorithm would predict that  the word `dog` had a much higher chance of being the next word than the word `meeting`. Many of you may be familiar with some aspects of this concept from CS136's WordGen lab, or CS134's Generators lab assignment, although, in that case you were likely using characters rather than entire words in your language models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Language models are a very powerful building block in natural language processing. They are used for classifying text (e.g. is this review positive or negative?), for answering questions based on text (e.g. \"what is the capital of Finland?\" based on the Wikipedia page on Finland), and language translation (e.g. English to Japanese).\n",
        "\n",
        "## The intuition behind why language models are so broadly useful\n",
        "How can this simple sounding algorithm be that broadly useful? Intuitively, this is because predicting the next word in a sentence requires a lot of information, not just about grammar and syntax, but also about semantics: what things mean in the real-world. For instance, we know that `I would like to eat a hot dog` is semantically reasonable, but `I would like to eat a hot cat` is nonsensical. \n",
        "\n",
        "I trained a simple language model, and asked it to predict the word following `I would like to eat a `. We get: `hamburger`\n",
        "\n",
        "The rest of this notebook will describe how to set up a language model using python modules available to us, to make such word predictions as well as classifications. We will use these modules to classify and generate text in an automated chatbot on Twitter and then reflect on the process, bringing together all our class discussions about conversational agents, natural language technologies, and human-in-the-loop systems!\n",

Remember that a language model predicts the next word in an input sequence of words. So, we can't just take some of the headlines and set them aside as validation data.

So if you say yes, you have to explain how/where you are going to display twitter data and see if twitter approves of it. For example, doxxing is one scenario where you would violate Twitter Developer policy by displaying twitter data outside twitter after collecting information about certain user(s).\n",

        "I was thinking we could have the teacher-learner model where the learner will generate fake stories that are realistic to read for both human users as well as the teacher. Then, the teacher will classify news stories as real or fake. However, we would need to train it on a lot more data, as well as find a way to incorporate the patterns of how news articles spread when they’re fake vs real. For example, where they first appear, the author’s number of citations, how quickly they went viral, and on which platform(s), etc...\n",

        "We can use mechanical Turk to help train and evaluate the accuracy of our algorithm. This approach, however, has some challenges. Even humans sometimes can’t tell when an article is fake, because it’s harder in this context to find a label or a specific indicator that can tell us that the news is fake. Whereas in the satire bot, the use of superlatives, ‘man’, and other words are pretty good indicators of the headline being satirical. Also, the bot’s potential to generate convincing fake news is concerning, especially for people who don’t have access to the bot, the fake news detection bot could end up contributing to the spread of misinformation instead of combatting it."
